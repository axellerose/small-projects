# Hi there!
## This is a set of small projects, where I sharp my HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript by creating small features to use in the future.

### List of features ###
0. Project Starter
1. Expanding Cards (an element expands on click)
2. Progress Steps (progress line)
3. Rotating Navigation (onclick menu page rotates and reveals nav menu)
